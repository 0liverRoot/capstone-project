Capstone Project Ideas

Project 1: Local Crop Planning Assistant for Urban Gardens
Description:
This web app helps urban gardeners plan their crops based on local climate,
available space, and seasonal factors. Users can input their location, garden
size, and soil type to receive a customized planting schedule and real-time
weather alerts. The goal is to promote sustainable food production by making
it easier for individuals to grow their own food efficiently.

MERN Tech Stack & APIs:
    MongoDB – Stores user gardens, plant selections, and schedules.
    Express.js & Node.js – Backend logic for crop recommendations.
    React – Frontend UI for user input and garden planning.

    Potential APIs:
    - USDA Plant Hardiness API (for climate zone-based recommendations)
    - OpenWeather API (for weather-based planting alerts)
    - Google Maps API (for soil and sun exposure insights)

Project 2: Disaster Resilience Hub
Description:
This app provides real-time risk assessments, emergency preparedness plans,
and local disaster resources for users based on their location. It helps
communities stay informed about climate-related disasters like wildfires,
floods, and hurricanes. Users receive personalized checklists, evacuation
routes, and resource maps to improve resilience.

MERN Tech Stack & APIs:
    MongoDB – Stores user profiles, preparedness plans, and resources.
    Express.js & Node.js – Backend logic for risk assessments and notifications.
    React – Interactive UI for emergency planning and alerts.

    Potential APIs:
    - NOAA/NWS API (for real-time disaster alerts)
    - Google Maps API (for shelters and evacuation routes)
    - OpenWeather API (for extreme weather tracking)
    - FEMA API (for official disaster response guidelines)


Project 3: Personal Carbon Footprint Tracker
Description:
This app allows users to track their daily carbon footprint by logging
activities such as transportation, diet, energy use, and shopping habits.
Users receive personalized tips for reducing emissions, along with data
visualization to track progress. The goal is to make sustainability
actionable by helping individuals measure and minimize their impact.

MERN Tech Stack & APIs:
	MongoDB – Stores user data, logs, and emission history.
	Express.js & Node.js – Backend for calculations and recommendations.
	React – Frontend dashboard for user engagement.

    Potential APIs:
	- CoolClimate API (for carbon footprint calculations)
	- Google Maps API (for route-based transportation emissions)
	- OpenWeather API (for energy use suggestions based on weather)
	- OpenAI API (for AI-driven sustainability tips)


Project 4: Nutrition and Food Security Tracker
Description:
This platform helps users track their daily nutrition intake, food security
status, and access to affordable, healthy food. It can include features like
meal logging, budget-friendly grocery recommendations, and community food
resource mapping. The goal is to help individuals and families optimize
nutrition while minimizing food waste and cost.

MERN Tech Stack & APIs:
	MongoDB – Stores user profiles, meal logs, and community food resources.
	Express.js & Node.js – Handles backend logic and API requests.
	React – Frontend for meal logging and visualization.

    Potential APIs:
	- USDA FoodData Central API (for nutrition data)
	- Google Maps API (for locating food banks and affordable grocery stores)
	- OpenAI API (for AI-generated meal plans based on user needs)
